        * Hoisting => Hoisting in javascript is a mechanism where we can access the function and variables even before it's declaration.
        * How Hoisting works => so the answer lies in the execution context.
        *                       When we write any code and even before of code execution a global execution context 
        *                       is created and in this phase memory is created for every variable and functions 
        *                       and assinged value to them  
        *                       for variable => (undefined) value
        *                       for function => function itself
        * 
        * so when we access the varialbe even befor its declaration the value is taken from the Global execution context.
