            Let, Var, Const are the keywords in javascrpt to declare a variable.

            let => let keyword is used to declare a block level variable
            var => var keyword is used to declare a golbal level varialbe, when we create a variable using var keyword is become a window       object property.
            Const => const keyword is also used to create a block level variable but some specialy is there.
                    1. Declaration and initialization should be in same place (line)
                    2. We cannot change variable value which declared using const keyword.
